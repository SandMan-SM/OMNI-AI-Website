## Running the App
The app runs on port 5000 using the "Start application" workflow:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Supabase Profiles Table
The app uses a `profiles` table in Supabase for user data, roles, and onboarding status.
The table is auto-created on first user profile access. Required columns:
- id (UUID, references auth.users)
- email, role (default 'user'), name, phone
- business_owner, business_name, business_niche, business_details
- activated_platforms (text array), onboarding_completed (boolean)

Admin user: sitanim6@gmail.com (auto-assigned admin role on profile creation)

## User Roles & Access
- **user**: Default role, access to /dashboard and /join
- **admin**: Access to /admin panel for user management
- Role managed via `useProfile` hook (client/src/hooks/use-profile.tsx)

## Onboarding Funnel (/join)
4-step funnel with built-in sign-up:
1. Sign Up (email + password, with "Already have an account? Sign In" toggle)
2. Basic Info (name, phone)
3. Business Info (yes/no business owner, conditional fields)
4. Platform Activation (18 platforms, 4 shown at a time, toggle on/off)
- Sign-up step is shown first for unauthenticated users; authenticated users skip to step 2
- Skip option saves partial data and goes to /dashboard
- Progress bar shows Sign Up → Basic Info → Business → Activate
- Hero "Start Free Now" opens sign-in modal; "Don't have an account? Sign up" navigates to /join
- Dashboard/Admin redirect unauthenticated users to / (homepage)
- Returning users with partial onboarding auto-resume from their last saved step
- Users who completed onboarding are redirected to /dashboard
- Dashboard shows "You haven't finished setting up" banner with "Continue" button

## Admin Panel (/admin)
- Protected route for admin users only
- View all users with stats (total, admins, onboarded)
- Promote/demote users to/from admin role
- View user details (email, phone, business, platforms)
