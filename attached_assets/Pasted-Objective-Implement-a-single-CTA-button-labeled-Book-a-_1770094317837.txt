Objective

Implement a single CTA button labeled “Book a Demo” that opens a premium, multi-step scheduling flow in a modal or drawer.

This flow should feel:

Fast

Intentional

Scarcity-driven

High-end (not Calendly, not Typeform)

1. ENTRY POINT (CTA BUTTON)
Button Specs

Label: Book a Demo

High-contrast (Neon Purple / Electric Blue)

Subtle glow + hover lift

Used in:

Hero section

Navigation

Pricing sections

On Click

Open full-screen modal (desktop)

Bottom-sheet modal (mobile)

Background blur + dim

2. FLOW BEHAVIOR (GLOBAL)

One question at a time

Animated transitions (Framer Motion)

Step indicator (●○○○)

Escape closes modal

Progress auto-saves in state

3. STEP SEQUENCE (FIXED)
STEP 1 — NAME

Prompt

“What’s your name?”

Single text input

Autofocus

Enter → next

STEP 2 — PHONE

Prompt

“Best number to reach you?”

Numeric input

Minimal validation

STEP 3 — EMAIL

Prompt

“Where should we send the confirmation?”

Email input

Validate before continuing

STEP 4 — DATE RANGE (SCARCITY)

Prompt

“When should we talk?”

Options (buttons)

This week

Show next 7 days

Randomly disable ~33% of days

Greyed out with lock icon

Next week

Fully available

Highlighted “Most Popular”

Farther out

Opens flexible date picker

Availability is simulated, not calendar-bound.

STEP 5 — TIME

After day selection:

Show 3–5 time blocks

Some labeled “Filling fast”

One-click select

STEP 6 — CONFIRM

Show summary:

Name

Email

Date & time

CTA:

Confirm Demo

4. SUCCESS STATE

After confirmation:

Headline

“Your demo is locked in.”

Subtext:

“If this is a fit, we’ll show you how Omni AI runs lead flow without manual work.”

Buttons:

Add to Calendar

Close

5. DATA HANDLING (SIMPLE & CLEAN)

On submit:

Log lead (name, phone, email, date/time)

Tag as demo-booked

Trigger confirmation email/SMS

Send internal notification

Do NOT build complex CRM logic yet — just clean handoff.

6. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Dark mode only (#050505)

Glassmorphism card

Neon gradient borders

Cursor spotlight active

Mobile-first spacing

7. FINAL INSTRUCTION

This entire experience must feel like a private invite, not a scheduling tool.
If it feels like Calendly or Typeform, redesign it.
