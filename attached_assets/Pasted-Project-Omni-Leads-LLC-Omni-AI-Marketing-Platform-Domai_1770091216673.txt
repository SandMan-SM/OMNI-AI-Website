Project: Omni Leads LLC — Omni AI Marketing Platform
Domain: omnileadsllc.com
Objective: Build a high-end, dark-luxury, conversion-focused marketing website that positions Omni AI as a tiered AGI-powered business operating system — not a SaaS tool.

1. CORE GOAL

Build a fully responsive, super-modern marketing website that:

Feels exclusive, powerful, and inevitable

Educates users through a tiered ascension model

Converts Tier 0 → Tier 1

Filters Tier 2–3

Hides Tier 4 (Holy GRAYL) entirely unless unlocked

This is not a mass-market site.
It should feel like the front door to something dangerous and valuable.

2. TECH STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Framework: React + Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Use backdrop-blur, bg-white/5, border-white/10

Custom glowing gradient borders

Animation: Framer Motion

Scroll reveals

Bento grid motion

Hover elevation

Icons: lucide-react

Fonts: Inter or Sora

Theme: Dark mode ONLY

3. GLOBAL DESIGN SYSTEM
Color Palette

Background: #050505

Panels: rgba(255,255,255,0.04)

Borders: Gradient neon wire effect
(linear-gradient with purple → blue → cyan)

Accent CTA: Neon Purple or Electric Blue

Text: Soft white (#EDEDED) with muted grays

Effects

Subtle grain / noise overlay

Glassmorphism cards

Hover glow

Cursor spotlight effect (important)

A faint radial light follows the mouse

Implement using CSS + mouse position listener

4. HERO SECTION (ABOVE THE FOLD)
Top Badge

Small pill badge with glow border:

“Introducing the world’s first AGI Legacy Model”

Main Header

Huge, bold typography:

Omni AI

Subtext

Short, lethal value prop:

Autonomous AGI systems that generate leads, run operations, and scale businesses without human micromanagement.

CTA

Primary:

“Start Free Now” → Tier 0

Secondary (ghost button):

“Book a Demo”

5. THE MODEL (BASED ON THE WHITEBOARD IMAGE)

The entire site hierarchy must be driven by this ascension model:

Peasant  →  Knight  →  Royal  →  Ascended  →  Holy GRAYL (Hidden)
Tier 0      Tier 1     Tier 2      Tier 3        Tier 4


This is critical.
Everything visually reinforces progression.

6. SERVICES PAGE — MAIN CONVERSION ENGINE
STRUCTURE

Use a vertical ascension layout (bottom → top), not flat pricing cards.

If accessed without permission:

“You are not ready.”

This tier is referenced indirectly only:

“Your thinking — preserved”

7. OTHER REQUIRED SECTIONS

3-column bento grid:

Self-Improvement

🔁 Omni AI Ecosystem

Visual flow:

📨 Contact / Waitlist

Minimal glass form:

8. PRO-TIPS TO IMPLEMENT AFTER MVP

After first build, improve with:

Spotlight cursor effect

Border glow intensity increases on hover

Slight parallax on hero text

Ascension animation between tiers

Lock icon animation on Holy GRAYL references

9. THINGS YOU WERE MISSING (IMPORTANT)

These will increase conversions a lot:

1. Narrative Copy Between Sections

Add short philosophical lines between tiers:

“Tools make you faster.
Systems make you inevitable.”

2. Scarcity Signals

“Limited Knight slots per month”

“Royal onboarding capped”

“Ascended by referral only”

3. No Testimonials (At First)

This brand works better without them initially.
Mystery > proof.

4. SEO Is Secondary

This is a direct-response brand, not a blog farm.

5. The Website Should Feel Like a Filter

If everyone feels comfortable here, it failed.
