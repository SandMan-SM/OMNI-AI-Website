Role:
You are a senior product designer + frontend engineer working on a premium SaaS pricing page.
Your task is to bring existing pricing cards to life with cartoon-style visuals and subtle motion while preserving the current layout, structure, and conversion logic.

🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT change:

Card dimensions

Padding or spacing

Typography scale

Pricing text

CTA placement or labels

Feature list structure

Do NOT redesign or reflow the cards

Do NOT animate price text or CTA buttons

All enhancements must be additive and reversible

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Enhance the pricing cards so they feel:

Alive

Stylized / semi-cartoon

Premium (not childish)

Market-ready for a high-ticket AI SaaS

Think: game character classes meets enterprise software.

🧠 DESIGN STRATEGY

Treat each pricing tier as a character archetype.
Add illustration + micro-motion using background layers only.

Tier identities:

Peasant (Free Trial): Awakening NPC, soft glow, curiosity

Master: Skilled operator, efficient, confident

Royal: Strategic commander, regal authority

Empire: AI overlord, abstract power

Holy Grail (Hidden): Mythic entity, obscured, forbidden

🎨 VISUAL REQUIREMENTS

Use stylized semi-cartoon illustrations

No chibi, no emojis, no flat meme art

Soft gradients, cinematic lighting

Minimal facial detail

Futuristic SaaS aesthetic

Illustrations must be:

Transparent PNG or SVG

Low opacity

Masked to the card shape

Placed behind content layers

🧩 IMPLEMENTATION RULES

Insert visuals via:

CSS ::before or ::after

Absolute-positioned background layers

Never place images inside text containers

Maintain full text readability

🎞️ ANIMATION GUIDELINES (MICRO ONLY)

Allowed:

Subtle floating (2–4px)

Hover tilt (≤ 2°)

Forbidden:

🧱 TIER-SPECIFIC EFFECTS

Empire: Particle fields, data streams

Holy Grail: Blur, partial opacity, hover-only reveal

🛠️ TECH STACK ASSUMPTIONS

Asset placement strategy

Notes on how to swap illustrations safely

Begin by auditing the existing pricing card structure, then layer enhancements without altering core layout.
